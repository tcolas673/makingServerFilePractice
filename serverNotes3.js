// without us having to write a bunch of redundant crap

// Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its own:
// An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.

// Middleware is software that provides common services and capabilities to 
// applications outside of whatâ€™s offered by the operating system. 
// Data management, application services, messaging, authentication, 
// and API management are all commonly handled by middleware
